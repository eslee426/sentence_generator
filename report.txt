Part 1: Build a more sophisticated grammar
sentence -> 
(nounPhrase verbPhrase) 
- This allows a sentence to consist of a nounphrase and a verbphrase - and ensures that a singular nounphrase is matched with a singular verbphrase. It also ensures that a nounphrase will match consistently have a present tense verbphrase
	Example: The dog runs

(nounPhrase-Plural verbPhrase-Plural)
- Similarly as above, this ensures that a plural nounphrase matches a plural verb phrase
	Example: The dogs run

(nounPhrase verbPhrase-Past)
- This rule ensures that that the tense of the verbphrase will consistently stay in the past tense
	Example: The dogs ran 
			 The dog ran

(sentence CoordinatingConjunction sentence)
- this allows you to combine sentences using a coordinating conjunction
	Example: I like cats and she likes dogs

(SubordinatingConjunction sentence verbPhrase)m
- This allows you to start a sentence with a subordinating conjunction
	Example: (test corpus sentence) Whether the prosecution will seek the death penalty in the case will be decided in a few weeks


nounPhrase ->
(adjectivePhrase AbstractNoun)
- Sometimes abstract nouns do not need to start with an article
	Example: Higher education

(Article adjectivePhrase Noun)
- Most singular nouns require an article, and this also deals with adjectives describing the article
	Example: The blue dog runs

(AbstractNoun)
- Some nounphrases are just an abstract noun  (without the artcle, like above)
	Example: Education is important

(Article Noun)
- (given)

(PreAdjective adjectivePhrase Noun)
- for words that specify an adjective even more
	Example: This blue dog is strange

(nounPhrase prepositionalPhrase)
- Handles prepositional phrases that describe a noun phrase
	Example: The dog, inside the house, is cute.

- Handles nouns that are made up of 2 nouns
	Example: Health care is needed.

Part 3: Rejecting Sentences
Two additional rules:
- Ensures that I do not have too many articles or conjunctions in a sentence 
- Ensures that a sentence does not have two consecutive subordinating conjunctions
- Could not get tree depth to work - so left it out
